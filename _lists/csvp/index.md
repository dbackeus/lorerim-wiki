**Made by TheConversation**

Colloquy's Skyrim Vanilla Plus is a modlist based on the visuals offered by 'Next Generation Visual Overhaul' from Biggie_Boss.  This is my take on his baseline, it is not a one-to-one baseline as there were quite a few things changed visually to my personal tastes. This list will require a fresh install of Skyrim: Anniversary Edition, and Wabbajack Installer (Please see the Read Me for Spec Recommendations and Space Requirements). It is intended as a packaged Vanilla Plus experience that can be played immediately with minimal effort.
