**Made by TheConversation**

Colloquy's Skyrim Vanilla Plus is a modlist based on the visuals offered by 'Next Generation Visual Overhaul' from Biggie_Boss.  This is my take on his baseline, it is not a one-to-one baseline as there were quite a few things changed visually to my personal tastes. This list will require a fresh install of Skyrim: Anniversary Edition, and Wabbajack Installer (Please see the Read Me for Spec Recommendations and Space Requirements). It is intended as a packaged Vanilla Plus experience that can be played immediately with minimal effort.

## About the List

First step of this modlist was reconstructing NGVO - I did away with many of the included systems/requirements (removed Creation Kit, no BodySlide Studio, etc) to streamline everything. This is a double edged sword, as it makes customizing the list easier in some ways but harder in others. This list has been divided and sorted into comprehensive Separators that will work seamlessly with any additions/subtractions you wish to make.  Be sure to look over any Flagged Notes on mods while customizing as they will help in knowing what needs reinstalling/patching when you make changes.

Second step was to personalize - I am a proud Vanilla Apologist, and the only goal for this list was a fresh coat of paint. The list is built on AE Edition but I cut out or modified a lot of the content that AE includes. I have added no custom followers, no new lands, and no sweeping changes to systems like Combat and World Scaling. I opted to enhance what was present; Fight through a grueling Civil War with choices and consequences, witness devastation and see overtime how the people of Skyrim adapt and rebuild, and choose new paths in quests that wont compromise the Dragonborn YOU want to be. Thousands of options for customization, smarter Fauna & NPCs, a more tactile world and more are waiting.

The final step was to make it installable - I have friends and family that love this game but lack the time or know-how to bring it up to modern standards. I wanted them to also be able to enjoy the bleeding edge of Skyrim Mods in as little hassle as possible. CSVP is my personal modlist that I decided to share so everyone can have that 2011 feeling again without ANY labouring away in MO2 or even MCMs.

### Disclaimer from Modlist Author

Please keep in mind that I am not a Mod Author, nor a Modding Expert. This list being a fork of NGVO really means that Biggie_Boss did all the bodywork while I just slapped some bumper stickers on, and I still made mistakes in the process! There will be things wrong with terrain and item placements,  and these will be noted and worked on as I play through the game. I included More Informative Console as well as Object Manipulation Overhaul for the intrepid ones amongst you, and I'm always open to hearing suggestions/additions you made to your personal list that could be thrown in here!
