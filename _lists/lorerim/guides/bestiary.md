## In Lorerim

The beauty of the Bestiary in Lorerim comes from an extensive patch made by [Patman023](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/patman023/mods?gameId=1704). An ultimate collection of creatures totalling 230+ entries. This Bestiary patch is a massive compilation made exclusively for the upcoming wabbajack modlist Lorerim v2.0. Over 100 extra entries have been added including completely custom creature entries not found anywhere else.

The patch comes with an extensive list of improvements including the following:
- Over 100 creatures added
- Untarnished UI patch Integrated
- Resistance/Weakness slots increased from 5 to 8!
- Requiem/Lorerim Resistances
- Requiem/Lorerim Weaknesses
- Requiem/Lorerim Loot adjustments
- Added a new icon for Daedric Weapons
- Changed Pierce icon to a Dagger to match requiem resistance
- When the requiem book "Bestiary of Skyrim" is read, all the creatures in the book will have their Bestiary entries unlocked!
- Added many more creature unlock entries to specific books and spells
- Adjusted wording of some entries to match the information in the "Bestiary of Skyrim" book
- Adjusted wording of some of the Dragon entries as their resistances depend on their breath type
- Dragonborn creatures are patched with Fozar's Dragonborn Patch in mind

A great change is the updates to existing entries to match the next-gen graphics of Lorerim. Which paired with the Untarnished UI patch makes for a brillaint look.
