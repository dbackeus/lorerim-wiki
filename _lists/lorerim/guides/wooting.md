# Wooting Profile for Lorerim
###### By Undeniable

This is a Wooting Profile developed by **Undeniable** for use with Lorerim. It requires any Wooting Keyboard and its web-based software to activate.

## Step 1
Head to your Chrome-operated browser and search or copy the following link to access the software: [Wootility Beta](https://beta.wootility.io/). Initiate your Wooting via the on-screen guide.

## Step 2
On the left-hand side of the screen, you will see all Keyboard Profiles and an **Import Profile** button next to the **Create Profile** button. Click on this and paste the following code:

`0eada0d55185a987bba7047ff008bcca4f2a`

## Step 3
The 'Lorerim' profile should now be downloaded and activated! To check if it's installed correctly, you can either:

- Look at your keyboard to see if the RGB color profile has been applied, and/or
- Check FN Layer 1 to make sure it matches the Guide's thumbnail.

This profile takes full advantage of per-key actuation points and SOCD to make movement more responsive and fluid by effectively reducing input delay. Timed blocking and magic dueling are significantly easier due to **Rapid Trigger** and **Tachyon Mode**. Additionally, **Mod Tap** has been used to make certain menus easier to access, stances easier to switch, and shouting and dodging more convenient. Swift Potion can be utilised by using the keys highlighted in yellow on the right hand side of your keyboard where the arrows keys would normally be.

### List of Features:

- **Console:** Opening the console can now be done by holding `ESC`. You no longer need to press `FN+ESC`.
- **dMenu & ENB:** The dMenu has been mapped to `[` and ENB has been mapped to `]`.
- **Stances:** Changing stances can now be done by holding `1-4`. You can still bind items to `1-4` via the favorite menu.
- **Wheeler:** The menu has been mapped to holding down `R`. You can still sheath and draw your weapon with `R` normally.
- **Beastiary:** The menu has been mapped to holding down `F`. You can still change camera perspective normally.
- **Shout:** Shouting can now be done by holding down `Q`. You can still access the favorites menu normally (requires further testing and tweaking).
- **Dodge:** Dodging can now be done by pressing `X`. Holding `X` for a full second will fully hide the HUD. You can still dodge normally using `Left-ALT` if you wish.

All of these settings are stored directly on your Wooting and as such require no input with MO2 or Lorerim itself to get working—besides launching the game, obviously! You should always change back to your normal profile via the software when typing or playing another game.
