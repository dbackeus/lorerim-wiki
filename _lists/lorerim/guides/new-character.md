# New Character Guide
###### By shallowgreen
New to Lorerim? A 3000 mods list can be intimidating but this guide will help you with your newly created character.

## First hurdles and leveling up...

...or venturing forth, dying, respawning, venturing forth, dying, respawning, etc. 
The early game is notoriously hard, and depending on your build, gear and preparation, tackling Bleakfalls Barrow (or even Embershard!) at level 1 is not a good idea. For reference, the general suggestion for BfB is somewhere between level 15-25. 

Note: Lorerim uses At Your Own Pace as mentioned in the [Quest Overhauls](/lists/lorerim/guides/quest-overhaul) guide.
If you're ever stuck in one of the greater questlines (i.e. main story, companions, thieves guild etc), give that page a read, you likely just have to speak to some NPC or do some more radiants.

Luckily, there's some great early ways of making XP & septims:

## Missives
Available to everyone right from the start, missives come in many different flavors, from simple courier duties to gathering ingredients, common and rare, to killing giants and clearing tombs (stay away from those for now). 
Each successful missive will reward you with 100 xp, along with either gold or items. 
These can be picked up at the missive board in any of the hold capitals.

## The Companions
Joining the companions gives you access to an endless string of radiant quests. You can pick these up indefinitely, even before having done Proving Honor. Aela always offers 3 quests - animal pelts, single animal extermination, and clearing animal POIs. 
Farkas always offers 2 quests - brawling, and clearing a POI. Once you're at the stage where Proving Honor is available to you - this happens after you have turned in your first 10 radiant quests, Farkas may sometimes send you to pretty powerful locations though.
Every radiant quest will give you 100xp and a nice chunk of gold on completion.
Big shoutout to the companions also giving you immediate access to a bed and safe storage upon joining.

## The Thieves Guild
Similar to the companions, the thieves guild gives you access to never-ending radiant quests, all of which you can pick up in one go. These don't just reward 100xp each, but are also highly lucrative. You will need some investment into Finesse and Wayfarer to finish these reliably. 
Note: you may rarely run into an uncompletable quest, there might be an out-of-bounds item or an uninteractable ledger - if this happens to you, you can either return to Vex or Delvin and cancel the Quest, or console it.

## The College of Winterhold
While the college doesn't feature endless radiant quests, it comes with a series of easy to-do introduction quests that will get you 100xp each, on top of free spells. The college is also home to the Arcanaeum, its huge library - which by itself should provide enough XP to go from level 1 to 6 in one fell swoop. You might want to pick up the "Absorb Knowledge" spell from Farengar's desk in Dragonsreach first though - unless you're really into reading. 
Similar to the companions, membership comes with lodging & storage.
Note: "reading" books with Absorb Knowledge will not start their associated quests (such as Lost to the Ages or The Legend of Red Eagle) - however you can just read them as you normally would to start their quests.

## Followers
If you're curious what kind of followers you can expect in Lorerim, check out [the followers guide](/lists/lorerim/guides/followers)
You can have up to 4 followers simultaneously in Lorerim, watch out though - they can permanently die if they're hit in their downed state. 
Followers like Jenassa (Whiterun, Drunken Huntsman) are easily accessible and rather than just carry your burdens, can even pick locks for you!

Once you have a few levels and some gear/spells under your belt, tackling general bounties from stewards and harder missives, as well as exploration and bandit-extermination really open up.
