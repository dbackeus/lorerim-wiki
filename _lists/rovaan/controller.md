Hi, Thanks for trying this out, please be patient if you find it a little unconventional at first try.  
It may not be what you‚Äôre used to, but there's good reasons behind the choices made üôÇ  
It should come naturally after a short while and a bit of muscle memory‚Ä¶

### INSTALLATION:
1. Place to patch at the bottom in ‚ÄúRULE 11‚Äù
2. Find ‚ÄúRovaan - MCM and INI Settings‚Äù in the output section, right click and open in explorer, go into ‚Äúroot‚Äù and delete the controlmap that's there.
3. Copy the URL at the top of this page and apply this steam layout to your controller.

### In Summary:
- **Interact** = Xbox A  
- **Sheathe** = Xbox X  
- **Jump** = Xbox Y  
- **Sprint** = Xbox B (hold)  
- **Dodge** = Xbox B  
- **Left hand block/attack** = Left shoulder LB  
- **Left hand Power attack** = Left shoulder LB + Left trigger LT  
- **Right hand attack** = Right shoulder RB  
- **Right hand power attack** = Right shoulder RB + Right trigger RT  
- **Dual Wield Parry** = Left trigger LT + Right trigger RT  
- **Powers/Shout** = Left trigger LT + Right trigger RT  
- **Sneak** = Left Joystick click  
- **Shoulder swap** = Left Joystick double click  
- **Inventory** = LT (while stationary) or RT (while moving) hold + Xbox B (then use the same side joystick to navigate the inventory)  
- Use X to left-hand equip and A to right-hand equip while holding RT.  
- **Magic menu** = Same as above but with Xbox Y  
- **Main Menu** = Start  
- **Map** = LT hold + Start  
- **Wait** = Select  
- **Skill Tree** = LT hold + Select  
- **Bestiary** = Dpad left double click K  
- **Helmet toggle** = Dpad up double click Y  
- **Quicklight** = Dpad right double click L  
- **Horse** = Dpad down double click H  
- **Followers Summon** = X hold + Dpad down  
- **Followers sandbox toggle** = X hold + double Dpad down  
- **Followers attack** = X hold + Dpad up  
- **Followers retreat** = X hold + double Dpad up  
- **Followers calm** = X hold + Dpad right  
- **Followers behind you** = X hold + double Dpad right  
- **Followers trade** = X hold + Dpad left  
- **Followers history** = X hold + double Dpad right  
- **Wheeler** = Left trigger LT hold + Right Joystick move  
- **Equip left hand from slot** = Left Joystick click  
- **Equip right hand from slot** = Right trigger RT  
- **To use wheel in the inventory** = Use LT + B or Y (for magic).  
  Keep holding LT and:  
  - **Make empty slot** = Right Joystick click  
  - **Delete slot** = Left Joystick click (keep going to delete the whole wheel)  
  - **New wheel** = Left shoulder LB  
  - **Next wheel** = Right shoulder RB  
  - **Place item in slot** = Right trigger RT  

### COMBAT:
- **Right Shoulder**: is attack or power attack with RT, explained by the author as:  
  ‚ÄúMy personal SKSE64 plugin for Skyrim which lets you power attack with a single key tap without messing with idle animations and DX scan code support‚Äù.
- **Left Shoulder**: Block or Left hand attack, or POWER ATTACK with LT or ‚ÄúDual wield parry‚Äù  
- **Hotkey ‚ÄúV‚Äù** with RB  
- Y = Jump, B = Sprint, X = Sheathe, A = Interact  
- **Select** = Wait  
- **LT + Select** = Skill Tree  
- **Start** = Main Menu  
- **LT + Start** = Map  
- **DPAD single click** = Unmapped, ready for SOULSY HUD or other customization.

### DOUBLE CLICK DPADS:
- **Down** = Horse  
- **Up** = Helmet toggle  
- **Left** = Bestiary  
- **Right** = Quicklight L (Rovaan doesn't have ‚Äúquick light‚Äù at this time üôÇ)  
- **Double click Left stick** = Shoulder swap  

### MENU Systems:
- **Right trigger** + A or Y  
  - While holding RT, press B to use the right joystick to navigate the inventory.  
  - Keep holding RT to use A to equip, or X to left-hand equip‚Äîall while moving.  
  - The same applies to the magic menu: hold RT and press Y for this menu.

### WHEELER:
- **Left trigger** + Right Joystick move  
  - If you prefer wheeler, hold LT and press B, keep holding LT and use the Left Joystick to navigate.  
  - To place something into a wheel, move the Right Joystick to bring up the wheeler menu.  
  - **Make new wheeler slots** by pushing down the Right Joystick, and delete slots by pushing down the Left Joystick.  
  - **New wheel** = Left Shoulder LB  
  - **Next wheel** = Right Shoulder RB (all while holding LT).  
  - The same applies to the magic Y menu.  
  - While in a wheeler slot, you can navigate the inventory with the Dpad.

### FOLLOWERS:
- **X + Dpad**  
  - While holding X, the Dpad becomes a follower controller:  
    - **Dpad down** = Summon  
    - **Double Dpad down** = Toggle sandbox  
    - **Dpad up** = Attack  
    - **Double Dpad up** = Retreat  
    - **Dpad left** = Calm  
    - **Double Dpad left** = Get Behind  
    - **Dpad right** = Trade  
    - **Double Dpad right** = History

And that's as far as I've got so far‚Ä¶  
Cheers,
