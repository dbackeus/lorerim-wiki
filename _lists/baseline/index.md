A baseline list to start your own Skyrim SE/AE modded experience.

This is just a simple modlist designed to build off of. It has the barebones necessities for Skyrim including: bugfixes, tools, xedit scripts. It does NOT have: visual overhauls, gameplay mods, etc.

The total download+install size is about 30gb (since it has stock game folder setup) as well as the latest version of creation kit.
