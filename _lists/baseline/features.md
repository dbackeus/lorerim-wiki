# Baseline Features

Baseline comes with many mods, bug fixs, tools and more to help you get started on building your list.

## Stock Game & Root Builder

BASELINE utilizes a Wabbajack technology called Stock Game. What this essentially does is create a copy of your Skyrim installation within the installation location of the list. This enables greater compatibility with other mod-lists.

BASELINE also utilizes Root Builder alongside Stock Game to enable easier management of hooks such as ENB, Reshade and Engine Fixes. Please see this guide to [Root Builder](https://github.com/The-Animonculory/Modding-Resources/blob/main/Root%20Builder%20for%20Skyrim%20AE.md) for more details.

## Core

The core additions that will help you build a stable and optimised modlist.

### Cleaned Plugins
Cleaning your plugins (typically .esp, .esm, or .esl files) is a crucial step in modding games like The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. There are several reasons why such as:

1. **Removes Dirty Edits:** Dirty edits are unintentional changes in a plugin that do not serve any purpose. Dirty edits can conflict with other mods, cause unnecessary load on the game engine, and lead to crashes or bugs. Cleaning removes these unwanted edits, improving stability and compatibility.

2. **Reduces Mod Conflicts:** Plugins that modify the same records (e.g., NPCs, objects, quests) may conflict with each other. Cleaning ensures that only intentional, purposeful edits remain in the plugin. This minimizes conflicts and makes it easier for tools like xEdit to resolve overlapping changes.

3. **Improves Game Performance:** Dirty edits and redundant data increase the workload for the game engine, leading to longer load times, stuttering, or even crashes. By removing unnecessary records, the plugin becomes more efficient, reducing the strain on the game engine and improving performance.

4. **Prevents Crashes and Save Corruption:** Redundant or corrupted records in a plugin can create instability, resulting in crashes, freezes, or corrupted save files. Cleaning plugins ensures that only valid, purposeful edits are made to the game files, reducing the risk of crashes or save corruption.

5. **Enhances Compatibility with Modding Tools:** Tools like xEdit rely on clean data to generate accurate load orders, patches, and conflict resolutions. Cleaning ensures that your plugins are standardized, allowing modding tools to work more effectively and providing a smoother modding experience.

BASELINE cleans the base game + the DLCs and the free creation club files. Additionally, Skyrim's textures have been cleaned with [Cleaned Skyrim SE Textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38775) which comes with some fixes and improves performance.

### Patches & Bug Fixes

BASELINE comes with a lot of the best patches and bug fixes made for Skyrim drastically improving the stability of game over vanilla.

## User Interface

Skyrim UI requires updating in order to utilsie a lot of the mods included and BASELINE adds many of the mods needed. The big one [SkyUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12604) which pretty much every modlist uses and every mod with an MCM requires. 

Other UI updates include SkyHUD, Racemenu, MCM Helper/Recorder, bug fixes for SkyUI and the very useful [More Informative Console](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19250).

## Animation Foundation

BASELINE also comes with the foundations needed to being modding animations. To start with, we have [Open Animation Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92109), an SKSE framework plugin that replaces animations depending on configurable conditions. As well as [Faster HDT-SMP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57339) which gives physics to capes, clothes and hair. 

BASELINE also comes with [XP32 Maximum Skeleton Special Extended](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1988) which  provides a highly customizable skeleton framework for characters in Skyrim, enabling enhanced animations, weapon placement options, and compatibility with animation overhaul mods.

Finally an additional fix to weapon switching and [Simple Dual Sheath](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50049) which makes the left hand weapon visible.
