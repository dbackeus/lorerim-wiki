**Made by Abandoned_By_Arkay**

Do Not Go Gentle is designed as Requiem modlist with Bruma, Wyrmstooth, VIGILANT, and lots of other additions to extend the life of your character playthrough. This list is not made to be painful list to play, but Requiem does make you plan out your actions more than vanilla Skyrim. The list is a reasonable compromise between difficulty and enjoyment.
