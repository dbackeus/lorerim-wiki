# New Combat Features
APW makes several changes to combat.

- **Sprinting:** Hold shift to sprint just like in Skyrim. Sprinting will consume more fatigue for more movement speed

- **Dodge:** At 50 Agility you can tap left alt to sidestep, and tap it again to dodgeroll (animations only work in third person, in 1st person you will see a transparent shader on your character during the iframes).

- **Backstab:** Enemies will take 20% more damage from behind

- **Critical Strikes:** Normal attacks have a chance to deal critical damage ((25% of Weapon Damage * Multiplier) + Base damage) depending on your Luck. 20% crit chance at 100 Luck

- **Parry:** The player gets a 0.2 sec parry window when they start blocking. Attacks made against the player during this time will result in a parry. A successful parry will stagger the enemy, reset the player's Poise, and refund 20% of base fatique. 

- **Power Attacks:** Power attacks break blocks and can be a good way to close gaps. Additional effects are added to power attacks depending on an actor's skill with their equipped weapon. (25% chance at 50 weapon skill, 33% between 50-75, 50% chance at 75+ weapon skill). Applies to both the player and enemies

  - Blade weapons can make the target bleed for 3 seconds
  - One-Handed Blunt weapons deal Fatigue damage + Silence for 3/4/5 sec.
  - Two-Handed Blunt weapons can weaken the target's armor for 3/4/5 sec.

- **Skyrim Style Bashing:** You can bash by holding block and using left click. Bashing deals 1 Poise damage and will interrupt and stagger Powerattacking/Blocking enemies. Bashing has a 1.5 second cooldown and requires 50 strength.

- **Lock-On:** You can lock on to enemies who are directly targeting you by pressing Q

- **Spell Favoriting:** You can favorite spells by pressing F on them in the magic menu. Outside of the menu, pressing F will open the favorites menu which you can scroll through with the mouse wheel.

- **Poise:** Between 1-34 Agility actors will take two hits to stagger, between 35-59 Agility they will take 3 hits, etc. Power attacks count as 2 hits in this system. Two handed weapons deal twice as much poise damage.
