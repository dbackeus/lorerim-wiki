# Frequently Asked Questions
Please checkout these FAQs before posting your question to the discord

### How much space?
~77GB total.

### I have a black screen on the main menu but can still hear sounds.
You have an AMD graphics card. Set `bFullScreen` to `0` in `Oblivion.ini` in the profiles folder of wherever you installed the list. Set the file to read-only so this doesn’t get reverted.

### I am crashing or stuttering constantly
Some random crashes are expected; Oblivion is an 18+ year old Bugthesda game and I am pushing it to the limits. I am still trying to make improvements, but nothing will get fixed if you don’t report it. If it can't be replicated, it is very difficult to actually solve. It's possible you may need to perform driver updates or rollbacks, or something else is wrong with your system. Check this [link](https://en.m.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Tweaking) for tweaks you can try.

### My mouse isn’t working
Restart Steam.

### I am moving very slowly
By default, you will walk. Press `X` to toggle running. Hold `Shift` while running to sprint. At a base, you regenerate 10 fatigue per second, scaling with endurance. Walking costs no fatigue, running costs 8 fatigue, and sprinting costs 16 fatigue. Fatigue costs are reduced by your athletics perks. Total movement speed is determined by a combination of your athletics, speed attribute, and equipped weight. Carrying a shield or dual-wielding also reduces your speed and athletics by 10.

### Why aren't my stats regenerating faster?
Many birthsigns offer some form of stat regeneration. Out of combat, you should sometimes use the wait function to restore stats. Potions should be used to restore stats in combat or when waiting is otherwise not possible. This is an intentional design choice.

## Combat is too hard
Combat is lethal on both sides. Make good use of the added combat mechanics and utilize spacing and reach to avoid being hit. It should feel engaging and require some strategy but not be overly punishing. If you think I’ve missed the mark here let me know about it.

Your race, class, and major skills will have a major effect on how your character scales for the entire game. Make sure you are primarily using your major skills. There are class changing profession books you can find in the world if you aren't happy with what you originally selected.

If you are a magic character, you should select a magically inclined race and a class with magic as a primary specialization or your magicka pool will not scale very well. Make use of spellcrafting, there are npcs in each guild hall which will do this for you without having to join the Arcane University. You can also sometimes find Welkynd Essence in Ayleid ruins which will let you craft one new spell for free.

As a melee or ranged character, your current fatigue affects the total damage you can deal as well as how fast you can swing your weapon. Agility or speed (highest of the two) also affect weapon swing speed.

Many enemies have been unleveled to no longer scale with the player and this is an open world rpg with no true ending. You can always leave and come back stronger. 

If all else fails, use the ingame difficulty slider to fine tune the game to your tastes.
