**Made by Sasquatch**

**A Painted World** is a complete overhaul of TES IV: Oblivion with a focus on stylized and timeless visuals, modernized combat, deeper rpg mechanics, and meaningful progression. It features expanded cities, additional quests, a more refined leveling system, more unique and detailed landscapes, and new lands such as Elsweyr. It is heavily focused on immersion and progression, and additionally has many slice of life features such as crafting, animal taming, fishing, home building/decorating, and more.

You must be prepared to cast aside your previous notions about Cyrodiil. The world no longer revolves around you, the player. Do not expect to be able to beat every monster or NPC you meet from level one. Previously familiar areas may now be much more dangerous and you will be forced to retreat from enemies who are too powerful to beat until you are stronger. You will probably die a lot more often now. However, if you have the ingenuity, skill, and luck to survive the odds stacked against you then you will be justly rewarded for your bravery!

If you feel overwhelmed by the difficulty when you first start out in this dangerous new world, do not be discouraged. Be cautious at first. Upgrade your gear as often as possible. If you find yourself facing overwhelming odds, run away and return later when you are more powerful to reap revenge on your foes. If necessary, seek help from the guards and legion patrols along the roads. The farther you venture from civilization, the deadlier enemies you will come across, and the greater the rewards. With every level you will become stronger than before. Don't give up!
