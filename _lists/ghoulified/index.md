Beautiful Graphics and 3BFTweaks gameplay. Ghoulified Reality is a hardcore perma-death focused modlist for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition that focuses on completely overhauling the game's visuals and gameplay to create a more challenging and immersive experience. 

**Made by Ghoulifed**

## Pre-Installation
Prior to installing Ghoulifed Reality, please complete the following steps.

- Install Visual C++ x64 & .Net Runtime v5 desktop x64
- Change Skyrim so it does not automatically update.
- Fully uninstall Skyrim by deleting the folder and the Skyrim Special edition folder inside \Documents\My Games.
- Fully disable OneDrive and any other programs which hook into user file areas.
- Reinstall Skyrim into a location that is not Program files. Somewhere like C:\Games is a good location. If you only have one drive, look into LostDragonistâ€™s SteamLibrary tool.
- Start the game once and let it do the graphics check. Do not worry about the settings as it will be replaced during installation.
- Launch the game to the main menu and allow it to download the free creation club addon files. DO NOT VERIFY YOUR GAME FILES
- Remove/Disable any 3rd party antivirus such as MalwareBytes or Webroot. These will mess with the installation and, in the case of the latter, causes more problems than it solves.
