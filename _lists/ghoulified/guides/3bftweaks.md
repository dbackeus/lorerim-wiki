Created by ANoobInDisguise and the Requiem Community, this mod aims to further refine and balance the already challenging Requiem experience, making gameplay more balanced and engaging for veteran players.

## Key Features

3. **Updates and Support**:  
   Regular updates are a hallmark of 3BFTweaks. Recent updates have added new files and patches, such as the "Infiltration - Quest Expansion" patch and the "Spell Hand Lights Removed" tweak, showing continuous improvement and expansion based on community feedback and new content.

   The mod is designed with a high level of customization in mind. Players can adjust various aspects of the game to suit their personal preferences, making it a versatile addition to any Skyrim load order.
