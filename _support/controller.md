### Step 2: Get the steam controller mapping
The link for the steam controller mapping can be found on the controller map Nexus mod page or linked below.

[steam://controllerconfig/489830/3399538109](steam://controllerconfig/489830/3399538109)

You can also check the [Modding Bungalo Discord](https://discord.gg/bungalo) for any potential new versions, within the lorerim-controller-support channel. The most up to date steam config will be available there. 
You can also check the channel out for discussion around controller support, including modification, and make a post if you require assistance with the controller config.

### Step 3: Apply the controller mapping
Paste the link into the address bar of your browser and when prompted click to open with steam. Make sure you have a controller plugged in and steam running when you do this.
If you do not get the prompt to open with steam, try disabling any ad blockers or use a private browser window.

Once the link has been opened in steam, it should bring up the controller layout window, which will show the button mappings and have a prompt at the bottom to apply the layout. Make sure the title of the control map is correct for the mapping you are trying to apply and then hit the prompt.
