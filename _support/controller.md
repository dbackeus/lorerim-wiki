# Controller Set Up and Installation Guide
###### By theDudeStandard & Emppaxis

## Step 1: Enable controller map
Open the Controller Support separator: disable the Lorerim Keyboard map and enable the Controller map. You can find alternate mapping configurations within the controller map mod.

## Step 2: Get the steam controller mapping
The link for the steam controller mapping is available in the instructions/readme. Paste the link into the address bar of your browser and when prompted click to open with steam. Make sure you have a controller plugged in and steam running.
If you do not get the prompt to open with steam, try disabling any ad blockers or use a private browser window.

## Step 3: Apply the controller mapping
Once the link has been opened in steam, it should bring up the controller layout window, which will show the button mappings and have a prompt at the bottom to apply the layout. Make sure the layout title at the top centre matches the control map you wish to apply and then hit the apply layout button.
