As of Lorerim 4.0, Complete Controller Setup is included for controller support. [Nexus Link Here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99978)

The mod is designed to work with the default steam controller layout. If you have an existing controller mapping from skyrim, carry out the following steps.

**1. Navigate to Skyrim in your Steam library**

**2. Right click and go to Manage>Controller layout**
