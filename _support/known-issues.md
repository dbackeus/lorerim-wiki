# Known Issues
There are some issues which may occur thanks to good old Skyrim jank. If you've ran into an issue be sure to check here before reporting it. Or better yet, read before you play the list to avoid running into the issue.
## General Issues

- Vanilla issue: Sometimes word walls don't do anything when you walk up to them. Just leave the cell and come back.

- Vanilla issue: A Soul Divided - Sometimes gets stuck. You'll have to either reload or complete the quest via console.

- Vanilla (or possibly Requiem) issue: Valdar the ghost might not be in Valthume after a certain point. To fix: console command -  "prid 8CE78" then type "enable"

- Vanilla issue: Sometimes Varona is still alive in Reluctant Steward. You can kill her and progress the quest via console.

- Missives sometimes bugs out with gathering quests. I recommend not picking them up.

- Crash on loading/changing cells: This can sometimes happen randomly due to either DynDOLOD DLLs and Lux. Please only report if these are repeatable. You can minimize these by setting page file, updating drivers and getting pre-requisites per GitHub.

- Saints & Seducers Thoron Bug: If he won't die, click on him in console, type "disable" then type "markfordelete" then type "setstage EC_SS_MQ102 89"

- Vanilla Bug: Brawl dialogue sometimes doesn't show up. Usually playing a bit then re-entering the area will fix it.

- Immersive Equipment Displays (you can fix anything yourself with backspace and navigating the menu)

- AE quests for alternate armors. These are intentionally disabled. All armor is integrated into the world instead.

- Vampires/werewolves bugs. Growl/Sacrilege is the best we got. Unless something is crashing, don't report it.

- Night Eye. This is an ENB-specific issue. Some ENBs have fixed Nighteye, some don't. Don't report these.

- Staff of Magnus Bug: Can't equip it immediately sometimes. Storing it in the quest item storage (press shift while hovering over it) and retrieving it from the mcm menu will fix this.

- ENB "issue": Odd reflections and/or glow on materials. Using COC commands a lot or alt-tabbing during loading screens can cause dynamic cubemaps to get wonky. If you start having texture oddities, just exit the game and clear your overwrite folder.

- Potions Require Bottles: It might seem like your game freezes when you run out of potions. It doesn't. Just press the space bar.

- Serving Time. It might seem like your game is frozen. It isn't. Requiem just makes serving time take forever. Go grab coffee.

- Lighting Crash: Game CAN CRASH when too many lights are on. Wearing too many lanterns, light backpacks, etc make this more common.

- Achivements: While most achivements can be unlocked while playing Lorerim, some are broken due to mods changing the core game logic which triggers them. Confirmed unobtainable achievements as of Lorerim 4.0 are Werewolf Mastered and Oblivion Walker.
