# Known Issues
There are some issues which may occur thanks to good old Skyrim jank. If you've ran into an issue be sure to check here before reporting it. Or better yet, read before you play the list to avoid running into the issue.
## General Issues

- **AMD USERS:** You should switch ENB Anti-Aliasing to FSR (Shift+Enter To Open ENB Menu). More Info Here: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/130669

- **Missives Bug:** Missives sometimes bugs out with gathering quests. It's recommended not to pick them up.

- **Souls Respawn Bug:** This might bug out if you become a vampire lord with Harkon. You can use `tcl` in the console to move into the next area.

- **Saints & Seducers Thoron Bug:** If Thoron won't die, click on him in the console, type `disable`, then type `markfordelete`, and finally type `setstage EC_SS_MQ102 89`.

- **Bruma** This mod is part of a larger project (Beyond Skyrim Cyrodil) and is really an unfinished teaser for it. There are some bugs and visual issues. Please don't report these :)

- **Staff of Magnus Bug** Can't equip it immediately sometimes. Storing it in the quest item storage (press shift while hovering over it) and retrieving it from the mcm menu will fix this.

## Vanilla Issues

- **Followers Resetting Inventories:** Sometimes followers can reset their inventories when they level. There's no known fix; itâ€™s random, so don't get too attached to follower gear.

- **Word Walls Not Working:** Sometimes word walls don't do anything when you walk up to them. Just leave the cell and come back.

- **A Soul Divided Bug:** Sometimes this quest gets stuck. You'll have to either reload or complete the quest via console.

- **Valdar the Ghost Not in Valthume:** This is a vanilla (or possibly Requiem) issue. To fix, use the console command: `prid 8CE78`, then type `enable`.

- **Varona Still Alive in Reluctant Steward:** Sometimes Varona is still alive. You can kill her and progress the quest via console.
