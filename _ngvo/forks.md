## Rovaan
A new Hardcore Wabbajack list featureing 1900+ mods with new gameplay features and Survival mode, Immersion, Improved Souls-like combat with MCO. Hard enemies and Bosses, and a graphics package on top using Biggie Boss's NGVO visual list. A EnaiRim\SimonRim mix with a de-leveled world and over 35+ new quests, such as The Forgotten City, Project AHO, Bruma, Wyrmstooth, and more! Over 30 new weapons and 100+ New Armor, All will be distributed all across the world, in chests, on enemies, and more!l While trying to maintain that magic feeling the Skyrim gave us when we first played it. 

Come, To Skyrim, Rovaan.
