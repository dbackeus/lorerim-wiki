## Adding New Grass (Giant FPS boost if you use performance grass like Skoglendi):

1. Remove all the mods in the "Grass" Section of MO2 (I highly recommend keeping Cathedral - 3d Solstheim Grass though, if you keep it you can also skip Step 4)
2. Go into NGVO - xEdit Output and remove "NGVO - Grass Tweaks & Bounds"
3. Add whatever grass mod you want (such as Skoglendi) and put it in the grass section of MO2 on the left pane and put it in the Trees, Grass & Landscape section of MO2 on the right pane
4. (If you didn't keep Cathedral - 3d Solstheim Grass) Disable all plugins in the right side that come after NGVO - Synthesis Patch and re-run Synthesis
5. Re-run Parallaxgen!!
6. Re-do your grass cache per the steps above (if you don't want to do this, you can simply disable Grass Cache Helper NG and NGVO - Grass Cache)

{: .important}
You should always check and final conflicts in xEdit before finalizing ParallaxGen and LODs

## Adding New Trees (Giant FPS boost if you swap Nature of the Wild Lands to something like Happy Little Trees):

1. Remove all of the Nature of the Wild Lands and related mods from the "Trees" section of MO2 on the left pane
2. Add whichever tree mod you want to the same pane. Make sure to grab any Dyndolod LOD addons for your new tree mod. You can usually find these on Nexus.
3. Move the plugins for the tree mod into the Trees, Grass & Landscape section of MO2 on the right pane. Place any patches after both the tree mod and the mod it's patching (E.G. if it's a patch for Lux, place it after Lux.esp)
4. Re-run Synthesis, Parallaxgen and LODs per the guides above!!
