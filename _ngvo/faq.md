Please checkout these FAQs before posting your question to the discord

## What is NGVO?
NGVO (Next Generation Visual Overhaul) is a comprehensive visually-focused modlist based on Skyrim V1.6.1170 (1.5.97 available on Discord). It comes with bugfixes, UI overhauls, sound overhauls and more. The only thing you need to add are your favorite gameplay addons.

## Common issue fixes
Please try the following steps to see if it fixes your issues:

1. Install Visual C++ x64 & .Net Runetime v5 https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe / https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime

2. Make sure you have the creation kit installed and opened once (you can find this in your steam folder) (Yes you need to let it extract all the files when it asks) https://store.steampowered.com/app/1946180/Skyrim_Special_Edition_Creation_Kit/

3. Make sure you have a fresh install of Skyrim

4. Launch the game to the main menu and allow it to download the paid addon files. DO NOT VERIFY YOUR GAME FILES

5. Make sure any 3rd party Antivirus such as MalwareBytes or Webroot are either disabled or given exemptions

If you have done all of these and still have issues please try reinstalling the list as this can solve issues that happen time to time.

## How to disable Northern Roads?
To disable Northern Roads: Simply Disable/Remove ALL Northern Roads related mods in the Norther Roads separator as well as the NGVO Northern Roads Patch.esp. You will then just need to re-run Synthesis, LodGen, TexGen and Dyndolod. Check out the ngvo-faq channel for more details.
