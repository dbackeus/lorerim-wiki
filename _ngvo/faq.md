## What is NGVO?
NGVO is a visual/bugfix/tool modlist designed to either play vanilla Skyrim with the best possible visuals or expand upon by adding new gameplay changes. 

Skyrim Anniversary Edition with the full $20 upgrade is required. NGVO runs on version 1.6.1170. You also need Creation Kit for Skyrim Special Edition which is a free download on Steam.

NGVO also aims to minimize plugin conflicts through the use of as many plugins as possible that don't edit vanilla records. HOWEVER one big culprit for plugin conflict is Northern Roads. Resolving Northern Roads landscape seam issues is relatively straightforward by following my landscape seam guide on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLibtlmBgRw) but if you don't want to deal with that, here's how to remove Northern Roads:

## Removing Northern Roads:

- Disable ALL mods under the "Northern Roads" Separator in MO2 (or delete them).
- Disable/delete ature of the Wild Lands - Northern Roads Patch.esp and NGVO - Northern Roads Patch.esp
- Delete the current NGVO ParallaxGen, xLodGen, TexGen, Dyndolod Outputs
- Temporarily disable all plugins in the "Flat Map Framework" plugin separator.
- Rerun Synthesis, Parallaxgen, xLodGen, (optionally grass cache/no grass in objects), TexGen, Dyndolod (in that order)
- Re-enable the plugins in Flat Map Framework plugin separator

## Common issue fixes
Please try the following steps to see if it fixes your issues:

1. Install Visual C++ x64 & .Net Runetime v5 https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe / https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime

2. Make sure you have the creation kit installed and opened once (you can find this in your steam folder) (Yes you need to let it extract all the files when it asks) https://store.steampowered.com/app/1946180/Skyrim_Special_Edition_Creation_Kit/

3. Make sure you have a fresh install of Skyrim

4. Launch the game to the main menu and allow it to download the paid addon files. DO NOT VERIFY YOUR GAME FILES

5. Make sure any 3rd party Antivirus such as MalwareBytes or Webroot are either disabled or given exemptions

If you have done all of these and still have issues please try reinstalling the list as this can solve issues that happen time to time.
