# LoreTrim

Ok so what is LoreTrim exactly? It's LoreRim but with a bunch of mods removed while trying not to touch gameplay. **This is not a fully supported list**

## So whats changed?

- City overhauls are gone. 
- Textures are generally lower res for landscapes and trees. 
- Grass and tree overhauls are simpler. 
- CS instead of ENB. 

Think of it as an even more redux version of Performance profile.

**DO NOT WHINE ABOUT XYZ MOD NOT BEING IN THE LIST.** I did this to just make LoreRim more accesible for folks who don't have strong PCs. 

In my testing, I was using 4-5GB of VRAM in Riverwood/Whiterun ON 4K. If your PC still can't run this, it's really time for an upgrade.

**Space Required:**: 176GB Download Size ~219GB install Size ~395GB Total

**ABSOLUTELY NOT SAVE SAFE WITH REGULAR LORERIM.** But I don't even have to tell you lmao. Your save legit won't load.

## How to Install

### Step 1

Download the archive from nexusmods, it can be found in the Optional Files of the [Lorerim Nexus Page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/112590?tab=files)

### Step 2 

Open the archive and extract the .wabbajack file. This file is the modlist file, used to tell wabbajack what modlist to install. Extract it to a folder where you can easily access it later.

### Step 3

Install the modlist with the modlist file.
There are two methods of doing this. Once extracted, double clicking the .wabbajack file and running with wabbajack should take you straight to the installation screen. Otherwise, you can open wabbajack, choose install from disk, and select the .wabbajack file in the Target Modlist path.

If you are wanting to overwrite an existing Lorerim install with the LoreTrim fork, select your current install directory as the installation path and tick overwrite installation.
