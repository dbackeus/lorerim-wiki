# Spare a septim?
###### From WhisperDealer
 
Help I'm broke, and worse...I live in the **UK!**

I maintain this site in my spare time and paid for the web domain along with it. As well as making websites for other modlists and other projects all of which are open source. I've made this as I love this community, both the Bungalo and the wider modding community and I wanted to contribute in my own way. 

However if you are able, I'd appreciate you supporting me on Patreon. As you will be able to see on the Gouldsonium page linked above, I make projects that are completelty open source for others to use and would like to continue to do so.

**Note:** This page will (hopefully) be deleted in future as I don't want to ask for help I don't need.
