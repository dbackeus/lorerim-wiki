# Character Creation Guide
###### By shallowgreen, BiggieBoss & WhisperDealer

Diving into Lorerim, the first thing you will do is create your character. 
In vanilla Skyrim this was as simple as picking a race and getting a few advantages, but in Lorerim there are many more options that truly define your character. This guide will help you understand your choices.

## Race

Make sure to also check out the attributes you're interested in, rather than just abilities - a lot of races come with very strong attributes - things like reduced power-attack cost or spell cost. 
If you plan on becoming a Werewolf or Vampire during your playthrough, these also get special bonuses depending on your base race:
- [Werewolves](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31245)
- [Vampires](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42408)

## Birthsigns & Standing Stones
This is the principal mod for all standing stones: [Link Here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/6668)

## Traits
In 3.0, "Medical History" has been replaced with *Traits* thanks [shazdeh](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/shazdeh2/mods?gameId=1704). This mod adds a host of new traits, inspired by Fallout New Vegas, with the goal of creating new and fun playstyles. At the beginning of the game you're given a power "Select Traits", activating it displays the menu where you can pick up to 2 desired trait.

| **Trait** | **Description** |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Au Naturel         | Flaunt what the divines gave you! Start with +100 more health, magicka, and stamina. For each piece of armor or clothes you wear, you lose 30 (up to -120 lost at 4 pieces). |
| Light Foot         | You've never felt comfortable in footwear. When not wearing boots/shoes, your movement is muffled, you move 50% faster and suffer half fall damage. Wearing boots/shoes slows you by 10%. |
| Unbound Hands      | Handwear constricts you. Spells are 10% stronger and unarmed attacks do +10 more damage when not wearing gloves/gauntlets. However, the opposite effect occurs when wearing them. |
| Glutton            | You LOVE food but hate medicine. Food benefits are 25% stronger, but potions have only 50% their efficiency. |

| Bad Natured        | Sneak attacks deal 20% more damage, and pickpocketing is easier. Non-sneak attacks deal 20% less, and wearing a divine amulet causes harm. |
| Hoarder            | Gain +100 carry weight, but selling prices are 50% worse. |

## Religion
While Wintersun provides the foundation, there are two further mods that tweak its effects, along with Biggie's own tweaks:
- [Wintersun](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506)
- [Wintersun - Tweaks and Enhancements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/107675)
- [Wintersun Skillrate Alternative](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60409)

**Three important notes:** 
1. Meditate (praying) is on a 12-hour cooldown
2. Some deities have had their effects tweaked significantly, for example Clavicus is not an easy perk farm
3. Lorerim does not use Requiem's highly restrictive religion system - feel free to commit (unnoticed) crimes, although some deities will abandon you like Wintersun suggests, for example when summoning the undead while following Arkay.
Should a deity abandon you, you can follow it again by praying at a shrine, starting back at 5 favor.

Shrine blessings work separately from the religion you're following - you can always grab a shrine blessing from a different deity, just make sure to cancel the popup asking if you'd like to change your faith.

## Destiny, AKA Subclasses of Skyrim
The destiny system is entirely custom to Lorerim, you can access it directly via your tab-menu, or from the "Destiny" power.  Accessing it from the power will also give you the option for a (costly) destiny respec. 
Destiny Perks are completely decoupled from your regular perks, and you can obtain a maximum of 7 of these perk points - meaning you can only get one "line" if you want one of the capstone perks at the end. 
Destiny perk points are obtained at levels 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30.
