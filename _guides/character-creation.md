# Character Creation Guide
###### By shallowgreen

Diving into Lorerim, the first thing you will do is create your character. 
In vanilla Skyrim this was as simple as picking a race and getting a few advantages, but in Lorerim there are many more options that truly define your character. This guide will help you understand your choices.

## Race

This is the principal mod for all basic racial stats: [Link Here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/6669)

Make sure to also check out the attributes you're interested in, rather than just abilities - a lot of races come with very strong attributes - things like reduced power-attack cost or spell cost. 
If you plan on becoming a Werewolf or Vampire during your playthrough, these also get special bonuses depending on your base race:
- [Werewolves](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31245)
- [Vampires](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42408)

## Birthsigns & Standing Stones
This is the principal mod for all standing stones: [Link Here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/6668)

>Tour available standing stones are determined when you make your first pick, either through finding a standing stone in the world, or using the "Choose Birthsign" power at any time during your run. 
>This first choice will lock you into one of four groups:
>- Warrior (Stones allowed: Warrior, Lady, Lord, Steed)
>- Mage (Stones allowed: Mage, Apprentice, Atronach, Ritual)

## Medical History, AKA Daggerfall traits
Reading the "Medical History" from your inventory will allow you to select from a great variety of beneficial and detrimental traits - you need to balance these, so you can't just slap-on every resistance under the sun and call it good. 
If you have already selected your start and made your equipment choices from the entity, the medical history will not be present in your inventory anymore. To spawn it back in, you can either navigate to the "Traits for Skyrim" MCM, or use the console. 
(This happens because the Starting Choices mod yeets any inventory you spawn with)

## Religion
While Wintersun provides the foundation, there are two further mods that tweak its effects, along with Biggie's own tweaks:
- [Wintersun](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506)
- [Wintersun - Tweaks and Enhancements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/107675)
- [Wintersun Skillrate Alternative](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60409)

**Three important notes:** 
1. Meditate (praying) is on a 12-hour cooldown
2. Some deities have had their effects tweaked significantly, for example Clavicus is not an easy perk farm
3. Lorerim does not use Requiem's highly restrictive religion system - feel free to commit (unnoticed) crimes, although some deities will abandon you like Wintersun suggests, for example when summoning the undead while following Arkay.
Should a deity abandon you, you can follow it again by praying at a shrine, starting back at 5 favor.

Shrine blessings work separately from the religion you're following - you can always grab a shrine blessing from a different deity, just make sure to cancel the popup asking if you'd like to change your faith.

## Destiny, AKA Subclasses of Skyrim
The destiny system is entirely custom to Lorerim, you can access it directly via your tab-menu, or from the "Destiny" power.  Accessing it from the power will also give you the option for a (costly) destiny respec. 
Destiny Perks are completely decoupled from your regular perks, and you can obtain a maximum of 7 of these perk points - meaning you can only get one "line" if you want one of the capstone perks at the end. 
Destiny perk points are obtained at levels 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30.
