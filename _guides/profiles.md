# Profiles Guide
###### By WhisperDealer

Lorerim comes 3 profiles:
- Ultra
- Normal
- Performance

Ultra is the graphically beautiful and fps intense profile which requires next-gen specs. Normal is a lighter version of Ultra for those looking to save some fps. Performance is for those on lower specs though you will still need mid range specs just to run the list.
