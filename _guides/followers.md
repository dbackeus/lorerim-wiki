## Follower Death/Injury

In Lorerim 3.0, followers can become injured or even be killed in combat. Be cautious during battles and keep an eye on your followers. You can heal them with a potion if they enter a kneeling state. If injured, followers will need time to recover before returning to full combat potential. Healing poultices are effective for both you and your followers.

## Author's Note

This guide is not meant to list every follower available in Lorerim 3.0, but rather highlight some new and improved options. Many other followers are available from vanilla game factions, locations, and quests, which may better fit specific roles or play styles. New lands and quest mods also introduce additional followers. Take time to talk to people and explore—you may be surprised at who’s willing to join you on your journey.

Lorerim is based on Requiem and enhanced by various mods and tweaks, making the early game significantly more challenging. This difficulty is intentional, and the game won’t be hard for long. Pick a follower or two early on that you like or that complement your build, but don’t go overboard. Lorerim is well-balanced, focusing on character progression and personal story. Be patient, plan well, and never give up. Happy hunting!
