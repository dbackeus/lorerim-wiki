# Creation Club Overhauls
###### By WhisperDealer

Lorerim requires the full paid to Skyrim Anniversay Edition update (AE for short) which includes content from Creation Club. If I were to describe these quests I would say...*"here, its all in this note"*. There is almost a whole category of mods that overhaul Creation Club content and Lorerim utilises some of these to provide a more fun, engaging and immersive experiance.

## Disabled Quests or removed items
Before discussing whats been overhauled, first lets highlighted what has been removed.

**Alternate Armors Quests**: The alternate armors from Creation Club are now part of the many armors found across Skyrim and Beyond. Because of this, the quests that were added to obtain these armors have been disabled. You will now find these distrubted to selected NPCs.

**Umbra**: Lorerim's main goal was to be as lore-friendly as possible and [Umbra](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Umbra) was destroyed/absorbed by Clavicus Vile in the books that were published before Skyrim came out.

**The Arms of Chaos**: The staff was shattered into pieces by the Eternal Champion at the end of Arena. Due to this, [The Arms of Chaos](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Arms_of_Chaos) creation was removed.

**Sunder and Wraithguard**: While technically, the [Sunder and Wraithguard]() creation was removed, another mod adds these items from lore back in a new quest "The Tools of Kagrenac". Read more about it our [New Quests guide](https://themoddingbungalo.com/lists/lorerim/guides/new-quests/#the-tools-of-kagrenac) 

## Saints & Seducers Extended Cut

*"Return to the Shivering Isles in a fully-voiced overhaul of Skyrim's Saints and Seducers Creation".* Saints & Seducers Extended Cut is an overhaul and expansion of the Saints & Seducers official Creation. A handful of elements from the original quest have been preserved and expanded into a new, fully-voiced quest. The mod will take players back to the Shivering Isles, first seen in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, for a polished, high-quality adventure through a new region of the Realm of Madness. 

This quest mod also affects the following Creation Club content: [Shadowrend](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Shadowrend), [Ruinâ€™s Edge](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ruin%27s_Edge), and the [Staff of Sheogorath](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Staff_of_Sheogorath) seamlessly integrating them into the new worldspace added.

To begin the mod questline, you must be at least level 20 and have completed [The Mind of Madness](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mind_of_Madness).

## Morihaus' Refuge
![image](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/68558/68558-1653387421-222371772.jpeg)

*Changes the Lord's Mail's integration by removing the existing quest and instead adding an entirely new dungeon and equipping its boss with the Lord's Mail for a challenging fight to acquire it.*

A brilliant mod by [Jelidity](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Jelidity/about-me?gameId=1704), this mod can be started by finding Morihaus' Refuge in Bruma.

## Knight of the North
![image](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/45869/45869-1613807188-1478306464.png)

Overhauls the [Divine Crusader](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/details/5666/Divine_Crusader_) quest with a completely reworked quest to obtain the Relics. This quest will have you travel far across Skyrim with an interesting backstory narrative to explain how the relics ended up in Skyrim.

Additionally the mod overhauls the Infamy system to be less harsh and more transparent and implemented a new system called *Honor*. 

To start this quest, next to every relic in the world is a journal or note that will begin the quest. However the mod author recommends to start near the Tower Stone in Winterhold. If you'd like to learn more, checkout the modpage [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45869).

## The Cause Tweaks - Alternate Start and Close the Gate
![image](https://static0.gamerantimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Skyrim-Anniversary-The-Cause-Guide.jpg)

A small change to [The Cause](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Cause) creation but with 16 time the immersion. As the modname suggests, this changes how the quest starts and allows the player to close the Oblivion gate added by the mod.

**Alternate Start:** *Instead of receiving a letter from a courier, begin this quest by finding a note on a body in the destroyed Hall of the Vigilant (the dead Vigilant on the table in the back).*

**Close the Gate:** *As in Oblivion, the gate opened in this quest can now be closed.  To conform with the existing layout, there are two sigil stones within the Deadlands area being guarded by the dremora there.  Both must be removed to close the gate, after which you'll be returned to Tamriel (permanently-- please make sure to pick up anything you want from this area beforehand).*

## Voiced Narrative

"Here, its all in this note" - Every CC NPC. Fortunetly a series by [GTheGenerous](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/GTheGenerous/mods?gameId=1704) called Voiced Narratives which as you might have guessed, voices the NPCs. The following mods are added:
- Bloodchill Manor
- Redguard Elite Armaments
- The Gray Cowl Returns
- Ghosts of the Tribunal 
- Fishing

## Simple Fishing Overhaul

Another banger by [JaySerpa](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/jayserpa/about-me?gameId=1704), this mods adds a plethora of new features which would take me too long to list so I'm just gonna link JaySerpa's video below.

## The Gift of Saturalia
![image](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/105697/105697-1702410467-965941506.png)

The Gift of Saturalia - A Quest for the Holidays is another mod by JaySerpa that while not requiring the Creation Club content, was built around the [Saturalia Holiday Pack](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Saturalia_Holiday_Pack). A fully voiced new quest. Help the people of Skyrim and spread the spirit of Saturalia.

You can begin this quest by finding a bearded old trader camping outside of Dawnstar, south of the main entrance.

## Reduced Cut

Some of the quests from CC can be prone to bugs or just unimmersive. Some mods with the label *reduced cut* remove the quests while keeping the added content. In Lorerim, 2 creations are reduced:

[Bow of Shadows](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81188) can be found as static loot as part of the Raven Rock/Morag Tong questline.

[Civil War Champions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/94999) - reduced cut removes the "Battle of Champions" quest and makes it so the player receives either champion set just before the final siege on Windhelm or Solitude instead.  Now you'll receive champion's armor once you have proven yourself and just in time to rub it in Tullius' or Ulfric's face.

## Creation Club Homes

Homes in CC are often easily accessible early in your playthrough which is unbalanced in Lorerim. Several mods have been implemented for **immersion**.

[Creation Club Home Requirements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/116032)
![image](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/116032/116032-1712435336-1682659034.png)

*One of the biggest weaknesses of the CC homes is being too accessible, too early into a playthrough. This mod aims to fix that by adding lore friendly requirements to several of the homes to ensure that players can't access them immediately.*

**Bloodchill Manor:** For this home, you'll need to complete the "Bloodline" quest in the Dawnguard DLC before being receiving your invitation to dinner. The quest will then proceed normally.

**Gallows Hall:** For this home, Gallows Hall will remain locked until you've completed the Conjuration Ritual Spell quest. Afterwards, the entrance will open and the quest will progress normally.

**Hendraheim** uses this mod which has been patched to work with [CC Hendraheim - Tweaks and Enhancements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98688). This makes several changes to home and how you get it. Mainly being that after defeating Eydvina Shield-Hearth, you have to buy the home instead of just being handed the keys.

**Myrwatch** also gets rebalanced with [CC Myrwatch - Tweaks and Enhancements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97659/) which makes the home purchasable and only after you convince Tolfdir. Checkout the mod page for more details.

**Goldenhills Plantation** from the Farming creation has also been improved upon with [CC Farming - Tweaks Enhancements and Quest Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69029). Before starting the quest, you can find the family still alive, with some custom dialogue lines and AI packages. To start the quest, you need to be level 15 (customizable) and talk to an innkeeper in either Rorikstead or Whiterun and ask them: "Are there any problems around town that need handling?"

It's worth noting the Tweaks and Enhancements mods are all by the same author [AndrealphusVIII](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/AndrealphusVIII/about-me?gameId=1704) who has many more great mods. I'd recommend checking out the profile as many more of their mods are in Lorerim.
