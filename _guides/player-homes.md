# Player Homes Guide
###### By WhisperDealer

This guide is a work in progress

Skyrim came with many homes for the Dragonborn to gain their well rested bonus, from modest homes in the 5 major capitals to building your own via the Hearthfire DLC. Lorerim adds to these options overhauling the existing homes while adding new ones through mods and Creation Club. This guide will show how these homes have changed, what have been added and how to obtain them.

## Vanilla Homes

In the following cities, all the way back in 2011 we had 5 player homes we could buy.

| Name             | Location            | How to Obtain |

## Hearthfire

The hearthfire dlc added 3 player homes which the player would build from scratch and had some customisation options which allowed the player to make the perfect player home.

## New City Homes

Each of the cities in Lorerim have been overhauled and included in those changes are several new player homes. A big change is the smaller capitals: Falkreath, Dawnstar, Morthal & Winterhold all have homes in the actual cities themselves, not just some land in the hold you can but. Additionally, the some of the other hold capitals have new homes added alongside the vanilla ones.
